            <h2>Why Our Buses Are So Great... Or Not</h2>
            <p>Are you looking for the most uncomfortable and unreliable transportation? Look no further! Our buses are a perfect example of everything you shouldn't want in a bus service. They’re always late, often breaking down, and never clean. But hey, at least you’ll have an adventure!</p>

            <p>Who needs a smooth, stress-free ride when you can have a bus ride filled with delays, rude drivers, and crowded seats? At our company, we pride ourselves on providing the least enjoyable bus service in town. It’s a challenge, and we embrace it!</p>
